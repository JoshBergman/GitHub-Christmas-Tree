### Are you lazy?, do you want people to think you actually make commits and push them? Well, I have a solution for you!

This program appends a character to a text file and then automatically commits it.
It's that simple!

### Usage:
1. Make your own duplicate repository
1. Make a text file
2. Copy the relevant information to the .txt file:
```
cd <DIRECTORY OF YOUR /REPOSITORY>
main.py
git commit -a -m "Important Changes"
git push origin main
```
3. Edit your .txt filename extension to .bat
4. Click the .bat file and watch as you have just made a contribution!

> Tip!
> If you really want people to think you're productive make your repository name something very serious like:
> "Important Revenue Generator For Business Growth. Machine Learning AI"
